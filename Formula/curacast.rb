# Curacast for macOS, installed from a compiled build. See the tap README.
#
# The bottles are the install path: Homebrew unpacks them and needs no Xcode
# Command Line Tools. The url/sha256 pair is the same content as a plain
# tarball, used only by `brew install --build-from-source`. Both come from
# scripts/build-macos.sh in the Curacast repo, one run per architecture, and
# are attached to this tap's GitHub release for the version.

    # ffmpeg this formula depends on, so a fresh install finds an encoder

    # Homebrew ffmpeg's own. The bottle ships this same wrapper.

    <<~EOS
      Start Curacast as a background service (it survives reboots):
        brew services start curacast

      Then open http://localhost:8000 and follow the setup.

      Your channels, settings and licence live in:
        #{var}/curacast
      Back that folder up. Updates keep it:
        brew upgrade curacast && brew services restart curacast

      Logs: #{var}/log/curacast/

      Plex on the same Mac: add the tuner at http://localhost:8000 (protected
      streaming puts the key in the URL shown in Settings).
